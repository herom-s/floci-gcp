# Contributing to Floci

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Floci is a community-driven project and all contributions are welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug reports**: open an issue with a minimal reproduction
- **Feature requests**: open an issue describing the GCP behavior you need
- **Pull requests**: bug fixes, new service implementations, or improvements
- **Compatibility tests**: add cases to `./compatibility-tests/`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 25+
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker (for integration tests that spin up sidecar services such as Managed Kafka)

Any Java 25+ distribution will work. If you need to install it, [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) is a convenient option:

```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
sdk install java 25-open
```

### Build & Run

This project includes a Maven wrapper, so you don't need to install Maven separately:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/floci-io/floci-gcp.git
cd floci-gcp
./mvnw quarkus:dev     # hot reload on port 4588
```

If you prefer to use your own Maven installation (3.9+), you can use `mvn` instead of `./mvnw`.

### Run Tests

```bash
./mvnw test                                          # all tests
./mvnw test -Dtest=GcsIntegrationTest                # single class
./mvnw test -Dtest=PubSubIntegrationTest#publishMessage   # single method
```

## Branching Model

Floci uses a **tag-driven release model**. Docker images are never published on PR merge, only when a maintainer pushes a version tag.

| Branch | Purpose | Docker published? |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Integration branch: all PRs merge here. Treated as unstable/nightly. | No (CI tests only) |
| `X.Y.Z` tag | Signals a production release. Triggers the full Docker publish pipeline. | Yes (`x.y.z`, `latest`, `x.y.z-jvm`, `latest-jvm`) |

## Commit Message Format

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): semantic-release reads these to generate the changelog and version bumps automatically.

> **The PR title is validated automatically by CI** and must follow this format, since it becomes the squash-merge commit message that semantic-release reads.

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

- **type**: one of the values in the table below (lowercase)
- **scope**: optional, in parentheses, identifies the service or area (e.g. `gcs`, `pubsub`, `core`)
- **description**: short summary in the imperative mood, no trailing period
- Append `!` before the colon to signal a breaking change: `feat(api)!:`

| Type | When to use | Version bump |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `feat` | New GCP API action or service | minor |
| `fix` | Bug fix or GCP compatibility correction | patch |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | patch |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit | patch |
| `docs` | Documentation only | none |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, no logic change | none |
| `chore` | Build, CI, dependencies, housekeeping | none |
| `refactor` | Code restructure without behavior change | none |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests | none |
| `build` | Build system or tooling changes | none |
| `ci` | CI workflow changes | none |
| `BREAKING CHANGE` | Footer or `!` suffix, incompatible change | major |

### Valid examples ✅

```
feat(pubsub): add StreamingPull support
fix(gcs): correct multipart upload final response
perf(firestore): reduce query lock contention
chore: release 1.5.16
docs: update README with new configuration options
refactor(pubsub): extract subscription delivery logic
test(secretmanager): add access secret version round-trip test
feat!: remove legacy v1 endpoint
fix(datastore)!: correct commit error shape
ci: add conventional commits lint workflow
build: bump Quarkus to 3.32.3
```

### Invalid examples ❌

```
Add PartiQL support                  # missing type
Feature: add something               # "Feature" is not a valid type
feat : space before colon            # space before colon
feat(pubsub)add missing colon        # missing colon
FIX(gcs): uppercase type             # type must be lowercase
feat(my scope): scope has spaces     # scope cannot contain spaces
fix(): empty scope                   # empty scope
feat(gcs):no space after colon       # missing space after colon
wip: still working on this          # "wip" is not a recognised type
```

## Architecture

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for a detailed description of the three-layer architecture (Controller → Service → Storage), the GCP wire protocol mapping, and conventions for adding new services.

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical agent instructions file for this repository. If your coding agent expects a different filename, create a local symlink to `AGENTS.md` instead of copying the file.

```bash
ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
ln -s AGENTS.md GEMINI.md
ln -s AGENTS.md COPILOT.md
```

## Adding a New GCP Service

1. Create a package under `src/main/java/.../services/<service>/`
2. Add a Controller (follow the correct protocol: gRPC, REST JSON, REST XML, or HTTP/protobuf)
3. Add a Service (`@ApplicationScoped`) and model POJOs
4. Add config entries in `EmulatorConfig.java` and `application.yml`
5. Register a `ServiceDescriptor` in `ServiceRegistry`
6. Wire controller/handler dispatch for the service
7. Add integration tests in `*IntegrationTest.java`

`ServiceRegistry`, `ServiceEnabledFilter`, and `StorageFactory` should resolve service metadata through existing service descriptors and storage patterns. Adding a service should not require new service-keyed switch statements in those consumers.

Always implement the **real GCP wire protocol**. Never invent custom endpoints. The GCP SDK must work against floci-gcp without modification.

## Protocol Compatibility and Upstream Evidence

Changes to request parsing, response shapes, status codes, error details, headers, persistence semantics, or supported operations must be based on evidence for the exact API version and transport being changed.

Before implementing or reviewing protocol behavior:

1. Identify the service, API version, operation, and transport.
2. Consult the canonical source for that transport.
3. Check the official SDK source when the client request or response handling matters.
4. When the documentation does not settle observable behavior, verify it against the live GCP service using the same API version and transport, when access is available.
5. Record the documentation links or live-service observation in the pull request description.
6. If upstream behavior could not be verified, state that limitation. Do not claim exact compatibility or invent exact error details.

Use these sources:

| Transport or question | Canonical source |
|---|---|
| gRPC request and response shapes | Published proto definitions in [`googleapis/googleapis`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), followed by the official RPC reference |
| REST JSON behavior | The service's official REST method and error references, plus its [Google API discovery document](https://discovery.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis) |
| Cloud Storage REST JSON | The [Cloud Storage JSON API reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api), including its [status and error codes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/status-codes) and [v1 discovery document](https://storage.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/storage/v1/rest) |
| Cloud Storage REST XML | The [Cloud Storage XML API reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/xml-api/overview), including its [status and error codes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/xml-api/reference-status) |
| Client wire behavior | The relevant official SDK's upstream source repository, not generated Javadocs or a locally installed JAR |
| General Google API conventions | The applicable [Google API Improvement Proposal](https://google.aip.dev/), such as [AIP-193](https://google.aip.dev/193) for errors |
| Undocumented observable behavior | A response captured from the live GCP service using the exact API version and transport |

Do not transfer behavior between gRPC, REST JSON, and REST XML without direct evidence. Similarly named operations can use different routes, status codes, error reasons, error codes, messages, headers, and response bodies. Search results, snippets, third-party articles, and emulator behavior can help locate evidence, but they are not protocol authorities.

For exact error compatibility, verify each applicable field independently:

- HTTP or gRPC status
- REST JSON `error.errors[].reason`
- REST XML `<Code>`
- Message text
- Response headers and body shape

Use disposable resources for live-service verification and do not modify unrelated cloud resources.

## Concurrency and Storage Invariants

Changes to resource lifecycles, parent deletion, object publication, locking, or storage-key formats must be designed and tested around an explicit invariant.

Before implementing or reviewing such a change:

1. State the invariant. For parent deletion, define which child states block deletion and which states must be purged.
2. Inventory every operation that can create, publish, move, restore, version, soft-delete, hard-delete, or otherwise change the protected state.
3. Serialize the invariant check and mutation with every competing state transition. Fix the invariant boundary, not only the call path that exposed the bug.
4. Define and preserve a global lock order. Confirm that no path acquires the same resource locks in the opposite order.
5. Keep authoritative state checks in the service operation. Controllers must not perform unlocked prechecks that can produce timing-dependent results or statuses.
6. Treat user-controlled identifiers as opaque. A storage-key encoding or delimiter scheme must be demonstrably unambiguous for every valid identifier, including identifiers containing the delimiter.
7. For storage-key format changes, account for legacy data, collisions, partial migration, retry safety, and every supported persistent backend.
8. Add deterministic interleaving tests for each competing operation. Do not rely on sleeps or probabilistic timing.
9. Cover both outcomes: the child mutation wins and parent deletion fails consistently, or parent deletion wins and the child mutation cannot publish orphaned state.
10. Verify that protocol errors and persisted state remain consistent regardless of the interleaving.

Document the invariant, competing mutation paths, lock order, and test coverage in the pull request. If a competing path is intentionally deferred, identify it explicitly and explain why the invariant remains safe without it.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Branch off `main`: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Open a PR targeting `main`.
3. CI runs tests automatically. All checks must pass before merge.
4. Keep PRs focused: one feature or fix per PR.
5. Reference any related issues in the PR description.

Docker images are never built on contributor PRs, so merging to `main` is always cheap.

### Pull Request Limits and Review Bandwidth

To make sure every contribution gets a thorough, high-quality review in a reasonable time, we ask contributors to keep **no more than 4 open pull requests**, drafts included, at any time in this repository, and **no more than 2 of them ready for review**.

- **Why this policy exists:** maintainer review time is limited. Capping concurrent open PRs prevents review backlogs, reduces context switching, and keeps PR cycle times short for everyone.
- **Dependent work:** if your work depends on a PR that has not been merged yet, build on that branch or note the dependency in the discussion instead of opening separate, uncoordinated PRs.
- **Draft PRs:** drafts do not count against the limit of 2 ready pull requests, but they do count toward the total of 4. You can have, for example, 2 ready and 2 drafts, or 1 ready and 3 drafts. Use drafts for work in progress, not as a queue of finished changes waiting for a review slot, and mark a draft as ready for review only when you have review capacity available.
- **How it is applied:** a bot turns a pull request back into a draft if it would be your 3rd ready for review, and closes a pull request opened while you already have 4 open, drafts included. Your branch and commits are always kept: mark the draft ready again once one of your ready pull requests is merged, closed or turned into a draft, and reopen a closed pull request once you have fewer than 4 open. Maintainers and dependency bots are not counted.

Once your current pull requests are reviewed, merged, or closed, you are welcome to open new ones!

## Release Process (maintainers)

Stable releases ship on the **1st and 3rd Tuesday of each month**. Merging to `main` does
not cut a release: the change rides the next train, and reaches the `nightly` image on the
next nightly build.

Releases are cut from `main` with the **Release Cut** workflow
(Actions → Release Cut → Run workflow). semantic-release analyzes the
Conventional Commits since the last tag, bumps `pom.xml`, regenerates
`CHANGELOG.md`, commits, tags, and publishes the GitHub Release; the tag
push triggers the Docker publish pipeline. Use the `dry-run` input to
preview the next version and notes without releasing.

`CHANGELOG.md` is generated. **Do not edit it by hand.** Your Conventional
Commit message is the changelog entry. Genuine corrections to the file
require the `changelog-edit` label on the PR.

## Testing Policy for Pull Requests

Floci accepts pull requests only when the test coverage is appropriate for the type of change being proposed.

As a project policy:

- Pull requests that introduce new behavior must include tests that validate that behavior.
- Pull requests that fix bugs should include a regression test whenever the bug can be covered realistically.
- Pull requests that modify runtime logic, request handling, persistence behavior, protocol compatibility, or service responses are expected to include updated or additional tests.
- Pull requests that do not change observable behavior, such as documentation updates, formatting, comments, dependency housekeeping, or low-risk internal refactors, may not require new tests.
- Even when no new tests are needed, the existing test suite must still pass.

If a pull request does not include new tests, the author should explain why in the PR description. Valid reasons may include:

- no functional behavior changed
- existing tests already cover the change
- the change is not meaningfully testable in isolation

Maintainers may request additional or more targeted test coverage before approving a PR.

CI runs automatically on every pull request, and build/test checks must pass before merge.

## Reporting Security Issues

Please do **not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities. Report them privately by emailing the maintainer or using [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
